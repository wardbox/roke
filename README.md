## Overview

Roke provides a comprehensive foundation for your Wasp projects by combining
modern UI tools and best practices. Built with shadcn/ui components, Motion
animations, and TypeScript support, it helps developers create beautiful,
interactive web applications efficiently.

## Why Roke?

I built Roke because I found myself repeating the same setup steps for every new
Wasp project. Instead of continuing this cycle, I decided to create something
that could serve as a thoughtful starting point, not just for myself but for
others too.

What makes Roke different is its focus on being a post-starter template. While
most templates give you a blank slate, Roke provides sensible defaults that you
can either use as-is or customize to your needs. It embraces shadcn/ui's
philosophy of being "Accessible. Customizable. Open Source." and extends it to
the entire project structure.

The vision for Roke goes beyond just being a template - it's about creating a
better developer experience through automation, making clean and modern design
accessible, providing real-world examples, and fostering best practices. By
making this project open source, we create an opportunity for mutual growth and
learning.

Remember: coding can be a creative and inspiring endeavor. Let's build something
beautiful together.
